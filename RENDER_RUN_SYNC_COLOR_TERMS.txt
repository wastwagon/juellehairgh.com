# Run this command directly in Render Web Shell:

# First, make sure you're in the backend directory:
cd backend

# Then run the script directly with ts-node:
npx ts-node scripts/sync-color-terms-to-production.ts

# Or if ts-node is installed globally:
ts-node scripts/sync-color-terms-to-production.ts

# Make sure DATABASE_URL_PROD is set in Render Environment variables first!
